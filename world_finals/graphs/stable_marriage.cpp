//  Stable Marriage problem
//
//  Given n men and n women, where each person has ranked all 
//  members of the opposite sex in order of preference, marry 
//  the men and women together such that there are no two people 
//  of opposite sex who would both rather have each other than 
//  their current partners. When there are no such pairs of 
//  people, the set of marriages is deemed stable.
